# push_swap

Certainly! Here's a summary of the knowledge gained in this push_swap project:

1. **Push Swap Algorithm**: You've learned about the push swap algorithm, which aims to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations: swapping elements, pushing elements between stacks, and rotating elements within a stack.

2. **Stack Manipulation**: You've gained experience in manipulating stacks, including initializing stacks, pushing and popping elements, shifting elements up and down, and accessing stack properties such as size and list of elements.

3. **Sorting Techniques**: You've explored different sorting techniques tailored for stacks, such as bubble sort, insertion sort, and advanced techniques like quicksort and merge sort adapted for stacks.

4. **Handling Command Line Arguments**: You've worked with command line arguments and learned how to parse and process them to determine the input values for the stacks.

5. **Error Handling**: You've implemented error handling mechanisms to detect and handle invalid input or exceptional conditions during the execution of the program.

6. **Array Manipulation**: You've utilized arrays to store and manipulate stack elements, including finding the minimum and maximum values, searching for specific elements, and rearranging elements based on their indices.

7. **Algorithm Design**: You've gained insights into designing efficient algorithms by optimizing operations, minimizing the number of steps, and considering various edge cases.

8. **Function Design and Modularity**: You've organized your code into separate functions, ensuring modularity and reusability. This allows for easier debugging, testing, and maintenance of the codebase.

9. **Memory Management**: You've worked with dynamic memory allocation, allocating and freeing memory for stacks and other data structures to avoid memory leaks.

10. **Code Style and Norm**: You've adhered to coding style guidelines, such as the norm, which promotes consistent and readable code, improving code quality and maintainability.

These are some of the key areas of knowledge gained throughout the push_swap project. It provides a solid foundation in stack manipulation, algorithm design, and code organization, which are valuable skills in programming and problem-solving.
